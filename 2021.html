<p>The idea of mascots was first introduced at the Grenoble Winter Olympics in 1968 but officially made the cut at 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. The mascots also bring in a lot of revenue to finance the Olympic Games through licensing and merchandising. The mascot of Tokyo Olympics 2020 is named as Miratoiwa.</p>
<p>Tokyo Olympics had been postponed and rescheduled, rather than cancelled. The opening ceremony of Tokyo Olympics 2021 was held on July 23 at newly-built National Stadium in the Japanese capital while the closing ceremony was held on August 8, 2021 at the same venue. Leaders from around 15 countries attended the opening ceremony of Tokyo Olympics.</p>
<p> Even though the 2020 olympics was rescheduled for 2021, the event retains the Tokyo 2020 name for marketing and branding purposes. Olympics 2021 saw the introduction of new competitions including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX, and Madison cycling, as well as further mixed events. These Games also included karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding make their Olympic debuts, as well as the return of baseball and softball for the first time since 2008.
A total of around 11,000 athletes from 206 countries have participated in 33 sports in Tokyo Olympics 2021.</p>
