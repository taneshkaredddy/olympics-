<p>The motto for the 2016 Rio Olympics was "A New World" </p>
<p>The 2016 Summer Olympics and commonly was known as Rio 2016, was an international multi-sport event held from 5 to 21 August 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with preliminary events in some sports beginning on 3 August. Rio was announced as the host city at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 2 October 2009.</p>
<p>These were the first Olympic Games to be held in South America, as well as the first to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country, the first summer edition to be held entirely in the host country's winter season, the first since 1968 to be held in Latin America, and the first since 2000 to be held in the Southern Hemisphere. These were the first Summer Olympics to take place under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach.</p>
